CBRN Information or Capabilities \\nIn the future, GAI may enable malicious actors to more easily access CBRN weapons and/or relevant \\nknowledge, information, materials, tools, or technologies that could be misused to assist in the design, \\ndevelopment, production, or use of CBRN weapons or other dangerous materials or agents. While \\nrelevant biological and chemical threat knowledge and information is often publicly accessible, LLMs \\ncould facilitate its analysis or synthesis, particularly by individuals without formal scientiﬁc training or \\nexpertise.  \\nRecent research on this topic found that LLM outputs regarding biological threat creation and attack \\nplanning provided minimal assistance beyond traditional search engine queries, suggesting that state-of-\\nthe-art LLMs at the time these studies were conducted do not substantially increase the operational \\nlikelihood of such an attack. The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or \\nbiological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and \\ninfrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key \\nbarriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI \\ncan help actors address those barriers.  \\nFurthermore, chemical and biological design tools (BDTs) – highly specialized AI systems trained on \\nscientiﬁc data that aid in chemical and biological design – may augment design capabilities in chemistry \\nand biology beyond what text-based LLMs are able to provide. As these models become more \\neﬃcacious, including for beneﬁcial uses, it will be important to assess their potential to be used for \\nharm, such as the ideation and design of novel harmful chemical or biological agents.  \\nWhile some of these described capabilities lie beyond the reach of existing GAI tools, ongoing \\nassessments of this risk would be enhanced by monitoring both the ability of AI tools to facilitate CBRN \\nweapons planning and GAI systems’ connection or access to relevant data and tools. \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristic: Safe, Explainable and Interpretable \\n',\n",
