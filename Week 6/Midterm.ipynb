Value Chain and Component Integration: Non-transparent or untraceable integration of \\nupstream third-party components, including data that has been improperly obtained or not \\nprocessed and cleaned due to increased automation from GAI; improper supplier vetting across \\nthe AI lifecycle; or other issues that diminish transparency or accountability for downstream \\nusers. \\n2.1. CBRN Information or Capabilities \\nIn the future, GAI may enable malicious actors to more easily access CBRN weapons and/or relevant \\nknowledge, information, materials, tools, or technologies that could be misused to assist in the design, \\ndevelopment, production, or use of CBRN weapons or other dangerous materials or agents. While \\nrelevant biological and chemical threat knowledge and information is often publicly accessible, LLMs \\ncould facilitate its analysis or synthesis, particularly by individuals without formal scientiﬁc training or \\nexpertise.  \\nRecent research on this topic found that LLM outputs regarding biological threat creation and attack \\nplanning provided minimal assistance beyond traditional search engine queries, suggesting that state-of-\\nthe-art LLMs at the time these studies were conducted do not substantially increase the operational \\nlikelihood of such an attack. The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or \\nbiological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and \\ninfrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key \\nbarriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI \\ncan help actors address those barriers.  \\nFurthermore, chemical and biological design tools (BDTs) – highly specialized AI systems trained on \\nscientiﬁc data that aid in chemical and biological design – may augment design capabilities in chemistry \\nand biology beyond what text-based LLMs are able to provide. As these models become more \\neﬃcacious, including for beneﬁcial uses, it will be important to assess their potential to be used for \\nharm, such as the ideation and design of novel harmful chemical or biological agents.  \\nWhile some of these described capabilities lie beyond the reach of existing GAI tools, ongoing \\nassessments of this risk would be enhanced by monitoring both the ability of AI tools to facilitate CBRN \\nweapons planning and GAI systems’ connection or access to relevant data and tools. \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristic: Safe, Explainable and Interpretable \\n',\n",

Information Security: Lowered barriers for oﬀensive cyber capabilities, including via automated \\ndiscovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities to ease hacking, malware, phishing, oﬀensive cyber \\n \\n \\n6 Some commenters have noted that the terms “hallucination” and “fabrication” anthropomorphize GAI, which \\nitself is a risk related to GAI systems as it can inappropriately attribute human characteristics to non-human \\nentities.  \\n7 What is categorized as sensitive data or sensitive PII can be highly contextual based on the nature of the \\ninformation, but examples of sensitive information include information that relates to an information subject’s \\nmost intimate sphere, including political opinions, sex life, or criminal convictions.  \\n8 The notion of harm presumes some baseline scenario that the harmful factor (e.g., a GAI model) makes worse. \\nWhen the mechanism for potential harm is a disparity between groups, it can be diﬃcult to establish what the \\nmost appropriate baseline is to compare against, which can result in divergent views on when a disparity between \\nAI behaviors for diﬀerent subgroups constitutes a harm. In discussing harms from disparities such as biased \\nbehavior, this document highlights examples where someone’s situation is worsened relative to what it would have \\nbeen in the absence of any AI system, making the outcome unambiguously a harm of the system.  \\n',\n",
