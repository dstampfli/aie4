We will cover the doctor's screening exam to see if you have a medical emergency. If you need follow-up services after your emergency care, your PCP or California Health & Wellness must approve it.\n\n## Emergency Hospitalization\n\nIf you are hospitalized because of an emergency medical condition, California Health & Wellness may transfer you to a network hospital as soon as the treating doctor says it is safe to do so. If you want to stay in a hospital that is not a network hospital after your condition is stable as determined by the treating doctor, we will not cover the non-emergency follow-up services that you receive from the non-network providers or in a non-network facility.\n\n## Enteral Nutrition\n\nEnteral nutrition is a way to provide food, such as formula, orally (by mouth) or through a tube placed in the nose, stomach or small intestine. We cover enteral nutrition products (such as formula), when there is a medical need. If you are under the age of 21 years, the formula might be covered by California Children's Services. Your doctor must first get a prior authorization from California Health & Wellness. If approved, you can get your formula with a prescription at a pharmacy that works with California Health & Wellness. See Section 5 about “How to Obtain Prescription Drugs” in this handbook for special details on the prior authorization process.\n\n## Eye Glasses, Contact Lenses, Low Vision Aids, Prosthetic Eyes, and Other Eye Appliances\n\nWe cover these items once every two (2) years.
