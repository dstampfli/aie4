        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

        "- The system (often a language model or an agent framework) parses the user’s input and determines which tool is most relevant based on the context, keywords, or the specific nature of the query.\n",
        "- For example, if the user’s input involves searching for general information on the web, the system might recognize that and select DuckDuckGoSearchRun.\n",

        "2. Explicit Tool Invocation\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Decision-Making Logic\n",
        "\n",
        "- There might be decision-making logic that ranks tools based on their relevance to the query or scores them according to how well they match the user’s needs. The tool with the highest score is then selected.\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, conversational agents, and other applications requiring access to a large knowledge base.\""

              "   'output': 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and traditional language models differ in several key ways:\\n\\n1. **Architecture**:\\n   - **Traditional Language Models**: These models, such as GPT-3, BERT, and others, rely solely on their internal parameters and training data to generate responses. They do not have access to external information sources at inference time.\\n   - **RAG**: Combines a retrieval mechanism with a generative model. It retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from an external knowledge base and uses this retrieved information to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\\n\\n2. **Knowledge Base**:\\n   - **Traditional Language Models**: The knowledge is static and limited to what was included in the training data. They cannot access or update their knowledge base dynamically.\\n   - **RAG**: Can dynamically access a large and potentially up-to-date external knowledge base, allowing it to provide more current and accurate information.\\n\\n3. **Response Generation**:\\n   - **Traditional Language Models**: Generate responses based on patterns learned during training. They may struggle with specific or detailed queries that require up-to-date or niche information.\\n   - **RAG**: Retrieves relevant documents or information snippets first and then generates responses based on this retrieved information, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate answers.\\n\\n4. **Performance on Specific Queries**:\\n   - **Traditional Language Models**: May perform well on general queries but can falter on specific, detailed, or niche queries due to the limitations of their training data.\\n   - **RAG**: Excels at specific queries by leveraging the retrieval mechanism to access detailed and relevant information from an external source.\\n\\n5. **Flexibility and Adaptability**:\\n   - **Traditional Language Models**: Less flexible in terms of updating knowledge. They require retraining or fine-tuning to incorporate new information.\\n   - **RAG**: More adaptable as it can update its responses based on the latest information available in the external knowledge base without needing to retrain the model.\\n\\nIn summary, RAG enhances traditional language models by integrating a retrieval component that allows the model to access and utilize external information dynamically, leading to more accurate, current, and contextually relevant responses.',\n",

It can involve concatenating the retrieved documents with the query before feeding it to the generator or using more sophisticated methods to integrate the retrieved information into the generation process.\\n\\n4. **Corpus**:\\n   - **Purpose**: The corpus is the large collection of documents or data from which the retriever fetches relevant information.\\n   - **Types**: It can be a static dataset or dynamically updated with new information.\\n\\n5. **Query Encoder**:\\n   - **Purpose**: The query encoder transforms the input query into a format that can be used by the retriever to find relevant documents.\\n   - **Types**: It can be a simple embedding model or a more complex neural network.\\n\\n6. **Document Encoder**:\\n   - **Purpose**: The document encoder transforms documents in the corpus into a format that can be efficiently searched by the retriever.\\n   - **Types**: Similar to the query encoder, it can be a simple embedding model or a more complex neural network.\\n\\n7. **Scoring Mechanism**:\\n   - **Purpose**: This component scores the relevance of each document retrieved by the retriever with respect to the input query.\\n   - **Types**: It can use cosine similarity, dot product, or other scoring functions.\\n\\n8. **Post-Processing**:\\n   - **Purpose**: This component refines the generated response to ensure it is coherent, contextually appropriate, and free of errors.\\n   - **Types**: It can involve additional NLP techniques like grammar checking, fact verification, and more.\\n\\nBy combining these components, a RAG system can effectively leverage large-scale information retrieval and sophisticated text generation to produce high-quality, relevant responses to user queries.',\n",

While RAG has shown promise in various applications, it also comes with several challenges:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Quality**:\\n   - **Relevance**: Ensuring that the retrieved documents are highly relevant to the query is crucial. Poor retrieval can lead to irrelevant or incorrect information being included in the generated text.\\n   - **Diversity**: Balancing the relevance and diversity of retrieved documents can be challenging. Too much focus on relevance might lead to redundancy, while too much diversity might dilute the quality of information.\\n\\n2. **Integration of Retrieved Information**:\\n   - **Coherence**: Integrating information from multiple sources in a coherent manner is difficult. The generative model needs to ensure that the final output is logically consistent and flows well.\\n   - **Conflict Resolution**: Retrieved documents might contain conflicting information. The model needs to resolve these conflicts effectively to provide accurate and reliable output.\\n\\n3. **Scalability**:\\n   - **Efficiency**: The retrieval process can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. Efficient retrieval mechanisms are necessary to ensure scalability.\\n   - **Latency**: The time taken to retrieve and generate responses can impact the user experience. Minimizing latency is important for real-time applications.\\n\\n4. **Training and Fine-Tuning**:\\n   - **Data Requirements**: Training RAG models requires large amounts of high-quality data. Fine-tuning the model to specific domains or tasks can be data-intensive.\\n   - **Alignment**: Ensuring that the generative model is well-aligned with the retrieval mechanism is crucial. Misalignment can lead to suboptimal performance.\\n\\n5. **Evaluation**:\\n   - **Metrics**: Evaluating the performance of RAG models is complex. Traditional metrics for generative models might not fully capture the quality of retrieval-augmented outputs.\\n   - **Human Evaluation**: Often, human evaluation is necessary to assess the relevance, coherence, and overall quality of the generated text, which can be time-consuming and subjective.\\n\\n6. **Bias and Fairness**:\\n   - **Bias in Retrieval**: The retrieval mechanism might introduce biases based on the underlying dataset. This can propagate into the generated text.\\n   - **Fairness**: Ensuring that the model generates fair and unbiased content is a significant challenge, especially when dealing with diverse and sensitive topics.\\n\\n7. **Security and Privacy**:\\n   - **Data Privacy**: Using external data sources for retrieval raises concerns about data privacy and security. Ensuring that sensitive information is not inadvertently retrieved or generated is important.\\n   - **Adversarial Attacks**: RAG models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks where malicious inputs are designed to manipulate the retrieval or generation process.\\n\\nAddressing these challenges requires ongoing research and development to improve the robustness, efficiency, and reliability of RAG models.',\n",

            "Prompt engineering is a concept primarily associated with the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the context of natural language processing (NLP) and large language models like GPT-3. It involves the design and crafting of prompts (input text) to elicit desired responses from AI models. The goal is to optimize the input to get the most accurate, relevant, or useful output from the model.\n",

The ability of these models to generate human-like text based on prompts led to a growing interest in how to effectively communicate with them to achieve specific goals. The term \"prompt engineering\" itself started gaining traction around this time as researchers and practitioners began to explore and document best practices for interacting with these advanced AI systems.\n",
