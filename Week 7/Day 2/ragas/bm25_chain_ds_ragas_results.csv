 "": 8\nReview: In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.""
 ': 19\nReview: The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!'
 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""]","The reputation of the John Wick action movie franchise is highly regarded for its stylish visuals, intense action sequences, and overall entertainment value.

 ': 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.'

After the first one already, I knew this wasn\'t going to be my thing. Not that ""John Wick"" is a bad film, it\'s just a very monotonous \'shoot-em-all-up\' actioner that rapidly makes you go like ""yeah, whatever"".'
 "": 16\nReview: John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.""

12,How do cutting-edge visual effects affect action film creation?,"[': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'

So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.""

It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US.

When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½'

In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!'
